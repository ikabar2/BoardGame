The Rules of the Game
Connect-Five is a game made for two players. Each player has a total of 32 circular
pieces. Each set is differentiated by colours; the A.I is yellow, and the user has red pieces. The
board consists of eight vertical columns and eight horizontal rows. The pieces are placed from
the top of the board and they fall down to the lowest empty square/row. Once the columns are
full of eight pieces, no more pieces can be placed in that column.
Placing a piece in any of the columns is called a “move”. Each player will take turns to
play their move, in our game the first player is determined by chance. The game can either start
by the A.I or the user. Both players have one goal; to be the first one to get five of their own
pieces connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
The player who gets five connected pieces is considered the winner of the game, if all the
pieces are used and no one is able to successfully connect five with all 32 pieces the game is
treated as a draw.
